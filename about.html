<h1>Who Is Grace?</h1>
<p>My names are Grace John Sudan, originally from South Sudan but a national member and citizen of he Republic of Kenya. I have studied in Kenya and currently schooling at Moringa School, where i'm learning skills on coding and web development.</p>
</br>
<p>My interests in coding and web development began when i started enjoying playing video games. Consequently, i grew interested in knowing how they were designed and afteer a few consultations with experienced fellows, i was led to Moringa School where i could learn the same.</p>
</br>
<p>Other than that, i enjoy other extra-curricular activities like swimming, singing, acting, playing video games and coding!</p>
